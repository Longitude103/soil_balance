# Soil Balance Package

This package will use several of the other packages to run a soil balance on the
parcel. This soil balance will be created to return a few different results but mostly
to return what the crop water use was, the soil deep percolation and the run-off values are.

## Items Implemented

- [ ] Create a parcel with basic attributes
- [ ] Load soil parameters for parcel
- [ ] Get Crop Water Use
- [ ] Get Precipitation and calculate run-off
- [ ] Get Irrigation Amount
- [ ] Soil Evaporation (future)
- [ ] Calculate Daily Balance
- [ ] Return daily deep percolation and run-off
- [ ] Return crop water use and evaporation
